virtual-reality-3D-Virtual-Environment--Realistic-Environment-with-10-virtual-objects

Developed a realistic 3D Virtual Environment as part of my Virtual Reality class. It contains 10 virtual objects, properly scaled as per the Unity Cube primitive. Imported models were taken from the Unity Asset Store. Used the Vive prefabâ€™s 'Real World Simulator' to ensure that virtual objects and environment have realistic scales and can be viewed with the HTC Vive. The Vive prefab is part of 5UDE, a package developed by Professor Ryan McMahan at FIVE labs at UTD. Copyright information inside the zip file.
